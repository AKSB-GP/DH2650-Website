Handling the main game-loop required a broader perspective on the project and understanding how each part interacted with each other. Furthermore I was also responsible for the  kill zone/respawning and the 4 player split screen functionality. What's more, I ideated many of the item functionalities and got the pleasure to help Sofia with implementing a few of the items. Finally, I also contributed with key concept art.",
